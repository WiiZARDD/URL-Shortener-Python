Welcome to the Bitly URL Shortener!

This simple Python script allows you to shorten and expand URLs using Bitly's URL shortening service. It's a handy tool for making long URLs more manageable and sharing-friendly.

## Usage

1. **Shorten a URL**: Enter a long URL, and the script will provide you with a shortened Bitly URL.

2. **Expand a Short URL**: If you have a Bitly short URL, you can use this option to expand it back to its original long URL.

3. **View Shortened URLs**: Check the list of previously shortened URLs.

4. **Exit**: Quit the Bitly URL Shortener.

Please ensure you have set your Bitly access token in the `config.py` file. Replace `YOUR_BITLY_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual access token. If you don't have one, you can create a Bitly account and generate an access token.

For more detailed instructions, run the script and choose the 'help' or 'readme' option.
